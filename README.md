# 📊 Recruitment Analytics Dashboard

## Executive Summary
This project delivers an end-to-end view of recruitment performance across multiple financial years, turning complex hiring data into clear and actionable insights. The dashboard consolidates hiring activity, time-to-fill trends, recruiter performance, and recruitment spend into a single reporting solution to support faster, data-driven workforce decisions.

---

## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to build a unified recruitment analytics dashboard that tracks the full hiring lifecycle—from job creation and applications to interviews and final hires. The solution enables analysis by financial year, role, location, employment type, and recruiter, helping stakeholders quickly identify hiring bottlenecks, monitor performance against service-level targets, and understand recruitment demand across the organisation.

---

## Key Insights
- Most roles were successfully filled, indicating a generally effective recruitment process.
- Time-to-fill varies by year and role type, with certain roles consistently taking longer to close.
- Application volumes are high, but conversion rates from application to hire are relatively low, highlighting inefficiencies early in the recruitment funnel.
- Recruiter performance varies significantly, with some recruiters consistently achieving faster and higher-volume hires.
- Increased recruitment advertising spend does not always correlate with improved hiring outcomes, suggesting optimisation opportunities.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Recruitment demand has increased over time, placing pressure on time-to-fill targets.
- Faster hiring outcomes are linked to clearer role definition and effective recruiter allocation.
- Improving early-stage screening offers greater efficiency gains than increasing application volume.
- Recruitment performance differs across roles and locations, reinforcing the value of data-driven workforce planning.

---

## Recommendations
- Strengthen early-stage screening to reduce application overload and improve candidate quality.
- Introduce role-specific time-to-fill benchmarks instead of a single universal SLA.
- Identify and replicate best practices from high-performing recruiters.
- Optimise job advertising spend by prioritising channels with higher hire conversion.
- Use recruitment insights proactively for workforce planning and hiring forecasts.
